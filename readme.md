# Random C2 Profile Generator

Cobalt Strike random C2 Profile generator

Author: Joe Vest (@joevest)

This project is designed to generate malleable c2 profiles based on the reference profile at https://github.com/threatexpress/malleable-c2/. 

!! This not inteneded for production

!! Generated profiles are designed to be used for testing variations 

!! of the reference profile.

## Overview

This project is meant to quickly generate a randome c2 profile. It is basically a Jinja template with random variables. 

Think of this a randomized version of the reference profiles found here https://github.com/threatexpress/malleable-c2/. 

There are other C2 profile generators that may work better for production like https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/C2concealer/

### Highlights you should be aware of before using

- Staging is disabled by default
- This does take advantage of other good practices found in the reference profile, but adds randomization (This is why the project was created)
- Does NOT use profile variants (see Profile Variants - https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-malleable-c2)
- URIs and DNS hosts do not try to be fancy, they are built using a random words from a word list.
- Settings are consistent across the profie. Each is just randomized.

## Setup

This has been designed and tested with python3

### Method 1: Quick and easy

```
pip3 install -r requirements
python random_c2profile.py
```

### Method 2: Keep your pythons separate and use pipenv

- 1st, Install pipenv for your environment
- 2nd, setup pipevn environment

```
pipenv -python 3.8
pipenv install
pipenv shell
python random_c2profile.py
```

## Generate some profiles

```
python random_c2profile.py
